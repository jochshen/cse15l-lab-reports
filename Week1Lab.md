6. In the terminal, type ```ssh <username from Part 1 step 5>@ieng6.ucsd.edu```
7. Enter the password you made from Part 1 (you won't see anything so don't make any typos )
After a couple seconds, you'll be prompted with a message that might look like 

```ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established. RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?```

**Type yes**

Your screen should look something like this

This means that you were successful

**Part 5 â€“ Run Some Commands**
Try running some of these commands in the terminal!
* ```cd```
* ```cd ~ ```
* ```ls -lat```
* ```ls -a```
* ```ls <directory>```, directory is ```/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc``` where ```abc``` is one of the other group members' username 
* ```cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt```

These are what your outputs should look like.

Some of them explained 
1. ```cd \```
![Image](LabImages/rootDirectory.png)
This takes you to the root directory which is just  ```\```. If I put ```ls``` after, you can see all files and directories within this root directory. We use public.
2. ```cd ..``` 
![Image](LabImages/allNames.png)
This takes you one directory back, from ```cd home/linux/ieng6/cs151sp23/cs15lsp23ho``` to ```cd home/linux/ieng6/cs151sp23```. This directory contains the account usernames of all the students in CS15L SP23. 
3. ```mkdir hello``` 
![Image](LabImages/mkdir.png)
This command allows you to create a new directory. As you can see after I did ```mkdir hello```, when I type ```ls```, a new directory called ```hello``` appears alongside ```wavelet``` and ```per15```


*When you're done, type exit to log out*
